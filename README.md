# **Speed Typing Game**
The Speed Typing Game is a program designed to test your typing speed.

## **Background**
This project was developed for my Computer Systems Programming course at Portland State University. The purpose of this assignment was to introduce us to the C language and into the world of Systems Programming.

## **How does it work**
The program works by recording the duration of time that it takes the end-user to correctly type each of the nine randomly selected words displayed to them. The program will display each word one at a time in a randomized order. 

## **How to run the program**
First, ensure that you have GCC complier installed on your local system in order to compile and run the source code. Once GCC complier is installed, from your terminal simply compile the source code by running the Make command. Once the file has been compiled, an executable file will appear within the same directory. Simply run the executable file from your terminal and begin testing your typing speed.
